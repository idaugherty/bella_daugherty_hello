I used GitHub Co-Pilot for this assignment. Co-Pilot helped me achieve the assignmentâ€™s potential in minimal time. Also, it accurately migrated the starter code to fit the specified needs of the assignment tiers. The AI was easy to use once I learned how to apply the changes. Dr. Owen walked the class through the assignment aided my understanding. I made changes created by Co-Pilot. The changes made were correct. My program kept trying to create a separate class when I ran it, but it would always create the same class within the program. The class stopped appearing when I used the debugger instead of running the program. Paying attention in class and using Co-Pilot has taught me to utilize my resources. The use of GitHub is familiar, but branches have proven to be confusing. Learning branching will be a useful asset to my skills of software engineering skills.

I copied and pasted the prompt into Co-Pilot, and it created the changes to my code. It released the second branch of code (I deleted the VS Code tab it was on, so I cannot get the response). I kept the code because it created the right output and used the correct processes to get the code.

The AI got the wrong code for the age. I have to go back and fix the objects for the age field. I would use some of this code in a real-world app because the objects would be useful when trying to keep track of personal information.
